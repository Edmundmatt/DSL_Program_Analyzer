# Assignment 1 Project Template

This project is a template for assignment 1, it contains classes, a build script with dependencies necessary for all tasks including testing support dependencies, Java settings, and a rudimentary grammar.  

The template can be compiled with `mvn compile`, this will generate parser and lexer code in `target/generated-sources`.

Do not change the names of packages, classes, methods, grammar(s) and `pom.xml` file (ask on the forum for permission to add additional dependencies or settings). 

Any non-permitted changes will be penalised during marking.
